#| It can be seen that the number, 125874, and its double, 251748, contain
exactly the same digits, but in a different order.

Find the smallest positive integer, x, such that 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, and 6x, contain
the same digits. |# 

(define (sort-digits n)
  (sort (string->list (number->string n)) char<?))

(define (permutation? a b)
  (equal? (sort-digits a)
          (sort-digits b)))
